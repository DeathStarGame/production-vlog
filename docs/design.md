## every video starts with the same journey summary

- 10-30 seconds, same as in Long Way Up
- what project is and waht is the goal

## facial reactions in subframe on what is happening on screen

- for example, "really?" reaction on some usual BS

## in general, parts of videos may be cut as if live streaming highlights (with camera in the corner)

- for reactions/comments
- or even: to point with hands at things on screen

## focus on project's journey, not on self, no bla-bla drag

- simple: use video editiing to create entertaining light-shedding video about the project's journey
- narration, comments similar to documentaries, serve the purpose
- but without boring pseudo-politeness: speaking out to and over the edge, show real emotions
- at the same time doing it dynamically and consicely, without occupying time for self-imporatance reasons
- pace it out to keep the project in the center, with self-humor, humility, openess, no bla-bla drag

## simple, cut-for-meaning, no visualization noise

- point is meaning, cutting of content into a linear video
- yes, some effects, like smooth cut may be benefitial
- but no need for fancy texts, transitions etc.
- the video should be dynamic, cut-to-convey-the-point
- like with ugly websites that focus on visual complexity, butchering the meaning
- videos should be like google.com, github or youtube - you get the value without unhealthy interface noise

## recording video on laptop, cam and voice over on the phone

- or get separate microphone/camera
- or use noise cancelling to remove fan noise from laptop
- if done via phone, audio needs to be improved and turned suitable for voice over

## use available tools: record/cut videos with available devices, upgrades will follow

- use existing devices to record whatever, cut a video
- better microphones etc. later if needed
- point is: well cut video, meaning does not require complex soft or superb devices
- using available tools will produce better videos
